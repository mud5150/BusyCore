# BusyCore
simple benchmark tool using prime number search

Uses a value in the config file as a ceiling for how far to test for prime numbers. It will take an optional int parameter to execute multiple threads. 
I'm using this to test for some anomolies I'm seeing between Winserver 2012R2 and 2016. I needed a benchmark with a fixed amount of work to test between OS releases.
